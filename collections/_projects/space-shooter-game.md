Out of all the many game _prototypes_ I've made, this is the most presentable code-wise. It's a command-prompt based Shoot 'em up game written in pure C++ where you play as a spaceship captain whose job is to destroy alien spaceships. I made this project as more of a coding experiment for me to learn Win32 APIs, including DirectSound integration.
