Not my personal project but a free and open-source game made with [Godot](https://godotengine.org) by [Revolutionary Games Studio](https://revolutionarygamesstudio.com) which I'm heavily involved in as a volunteer since 2020. As a member of the core programming team, I work on various things from user interface (the screenshot above shows a user interface which is mainly implemented by me), gameplay features to bug-fixing. Often, I'm also involved in reviewing pull requests to the codebase made by open-source contributors and fellow team members. Check it out on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1779200/Thrive/)!
