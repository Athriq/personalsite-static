My most proper unfinished game prototype ever. It's intended to be a grand remake of the [popular horror game](https://www.scpcbgame.com) of the same name in [Unity3D](https://unity.com), with enhanced inventory system, enriched story line and more dramatic in-game events - immersing the player deeper in the SCP universe - but I only got around to doing the intro sequence part. Even though the majority of the assets shown are from the original game, I modeled the environments and animated the characters myself. I've since lost the project files, although some of the (spaghetti) code are still [available for view](https://github.com/athariqk/SCPCB-Remake-Scripts).

I don't know, I might take on this project once again some day.
