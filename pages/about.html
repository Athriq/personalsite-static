        <p>
            Halo. My name is <b>Ahmad Ghalib Athariq</b>, I'm 21 years old. I live in <abbr
                title="Eastern Hemisphere of the Earth, Solar System, Orion Arm of the Milky Way, Local Group, The Observable Universe">Medan,
                Indonesia</abbr>. I have been coding since I was little to make things I love and I'm eager to build
            meaningful software that help improve people's lives. I'm currently pursuing computer science at a
            university in the same
            city.

            As a kid who spent too much time playing games, I discovered game making tools at a relatively young age,
            which
            I found to be an ideal space to channel my inner burning creativity into the digital world. Along the way, I
            learnt the art of programming as a side effect and the field of computing in general which I intend to have
            a
            career in. In between all of that, I have <em>some</em> interest in writing and art.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond that, I always have a deep fascination with the sciences and nature, often pondering in philosophical
            thoughts and appreciating the beauty of the world, the society, civilization, humankind and this life. I
            yearn
            to find meaning in everyday life and contribute something good to the world around me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I may write my personal thoughts on various topics on my <a href="/blog">blog</a> from time to time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thanks for reading :)
